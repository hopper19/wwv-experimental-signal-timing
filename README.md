# WWV/WWVH Experimental Signal Timing Project
The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm and code that can most accurately determine the timing of the pseudorandom Gaussian white noise sequences and the chirps in a received signal file. Timing here is defined as the relative amount of time that has elapsed from a defined point in the first pseudorandom Gaussian white noise burst to a defined point on each subsequent feature.
